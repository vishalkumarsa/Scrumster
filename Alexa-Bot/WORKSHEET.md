The Worksheet is broken down into 4 parts for each week of the sprint. The first week covers the Use Case refinement section of the Deliverable. The next 3 weeks focuses on each of the Use Cases and their corresponding subflows and alternative flows. Under each subflow or alternative flow is a list of tasks (JIRA links provided) pertaining to that particular subflow(eg. Design, implementation, mocking, selenium testing etc). Our tasks are denoted on the JIRA Board as SD-{ID}.

The completed Scrumboard is as follows: [JIRA Scrum Board](https://scrumster.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=2&view=detail&selectedIssue=SD-24)
